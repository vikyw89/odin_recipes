        Description
    </h2>
    <p>
        My favorite food of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients. 
        The secret is in the broth: this is the most amazing, flavorsome Chinese chicken rice dish you've ever tried.
        Garnish with sliced cucumber, sprigs of spring onions, and cilantro.

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Trim chicken of all excess fat, reserving fat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place chicken, spring onion, 3 cloves crushed garlic, and one 1-inch piece ginger in a large pot. 
            Pour in enough water to cover. 
            Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming any scum off the surface, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from the pot, reserving broth. 
            Rub chicken with salt. 
            Chop into pieces and arrange on a serving plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine soy sauce, 3 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, garlic oil, and sesame oil in a small bowl. 
            Drizzle over chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt reserved chicken fat in a large pot over medium heat. 
            Add rice, 3 cloves minced garlic, crushed 1-inch piece ginger, and salt; cook and stir until rice is glossy and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour enough reserved chicken broth into the pot to cover rice by half an inch. 
            Cover; bring to a boil. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Let rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. 
            Fluff with a fork.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine red chile peppers, juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1/2-inch piece ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 pinch sugar in a blender; blend until garlic chile dip is smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1-inch piece ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until ginger dip is smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve garlic chile and ginger dips alongside chicken and rice.
        </li>
