            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really.
            It is composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!

            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain and discard any excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish; spread about half the can of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer.
            </li>
            <li>    
                Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.
            </li>

            </li>
